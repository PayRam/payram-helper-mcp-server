### Key dashboards

The Analytics module is organised into three sections for clarity and focus:

#### Revenue Insights

Keep track of your earnings and identify trends that shape your business growth.

**You can view:**

* Total and net revenue
* Growth rate and time-based trends
* Average order value (AOV)
* Top-performing products or stores
* Revenue share by network or payment method

> Tip: Filter by time period (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) to monitor performance across campaigns or regions.

#### Customer Analytics

Understand who your customers are and how they interact with your platform.

**Metrics include:**

* **Acquisition:** Number of new customers in a selected period
* **Retention:** Returning customer rates and churn patterns
* **ARPU (Average Revenue per User):** Calculate user profitability
* **Top segments:** Identify high-value or repeat customers

> Use case: Discover if your new payment options improve retention or reduce churn over time.

#### Transaction Health

Track the pulse of your payment operations and ensure frictionless experiences.

**Metrics include:**

* Payment success rate
* Decline and failure reasons
* Popular payment networks and tokens used
* Average processing time
* Settlement lag by region or method

> Insight: If your success rate dips for a particular token or network, you can act fast — either optimize configurations or notify customers.
