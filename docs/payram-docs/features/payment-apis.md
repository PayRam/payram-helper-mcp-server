Integrate PayRam’s Payment APIs to drive transactions from your app or backend, handle payments, webhooks, and more, all under your control.

***

### **Why it matters**

* **Full automations:** Let your backend create and manage payments, no manual intervention.
* **Custom workflows:** Tailor logic before triggering a payment.
* **Real-time feedback:** Use webhooks to react to payments as they arrive or settle.
* **Scalability & control:** Integrate with your architecture and scale usage programmatically.

### **Managing API keys**

API keys are required to authenticate all PayRam API requests. Each key is tied to a specific **project**, allowing for environment-level control and security.

**Creating or managing API keys:**

1. Go to **Settings → Accounts** in your PayRam dashboard.
2. Select the **Project** you want to integrate.
3. Navigate to **API Keys**.
4. Copy your **Key**.
5. You can also create new API Keys by clicking on **Add New**.
6. You can also deactivate existing keys by toggling them to inactive.
