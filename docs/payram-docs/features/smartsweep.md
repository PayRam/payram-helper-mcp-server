SmartSweep automatically transfers funds from Customer Deposit Wallets to your designated Cold Wallet, helping you consolidate balances securely and efficiently, without manual intervention or exposed keys.

***

### **Why it matters**

* **Save time:** No more manual consolidation of deposits.
* **Improve efficiency:** Maintain optimal wallet balances for payouts and settlements.
* **Enhance security:** Sweep operations use smart contracts, not private keys.
* **Stay audit-ready:** Every sweep transaction is logged and traceable.
* **Lower costs:** Fewer transactions mean reduced operational and network fees.
