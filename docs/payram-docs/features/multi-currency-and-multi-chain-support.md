PayRam enables seamless payments across multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks empowering merchants and customers with flexibility, global reach, and interoperability.

### **Why it matters**

* **Global reach:** Accept payments from anywhere, in the user’s preferred currency or chain.
* **Higher conversion rates:** Reduce drop-offs by supporting the most popular tokens and networks.
* **Hedging flexibility:** Settle in stablecoins (USDC, USDT) or crypto assets (BTC, ETH) as needed.
* **Seamless integration:** One API handles all currencies and chains, no separate setup required.
* **Future-proof:** PayRam continues expanding support as new chains gain traction.
