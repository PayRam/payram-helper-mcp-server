Add teammates to your PayRam dashboard and assign roles based on what they need to do.

Give full control to your operations team or grant limited permissions to specific projects. Every role stays secure.

***

### **Why it matters**

* **Operate safely** without sharing sensitive credentials.
* **Customize access** based on roles and responsibilities.
* **Maintain compliance** through role-based data segregation.
* **Simplify teamwork** across projects, payments, and referrals.
