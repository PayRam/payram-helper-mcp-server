This release marks a major milestone for us. We’ve reworked the architecture of our core blockchain orchestration stack, pushing forward our mission to make crypto payments effortless, secure, and future-ready.

At PayRam, our guiding principle has always been security. We don’t store private keys, and we never compromise on how funds are received and swept. Today, we’re taking that philosophy even further.

### Meet PayRam SmartSweep

With **SmartSweep**, you no longer need to set up xPUBs or manually authorize wallets across chains. For any blockchain that supports smart contracts, deposit wallets are now nearly instant to configure. It’s the simplest way to start accepting crypto.

Seamlessly, you can support multiple ERC-20 and TRC-20 tokens without worrying about orchestration, consolidation, or sweeps. PayRam automatically deploys a family of smart contracts that securely collect and route funds straight to your cold wallets—without ever exposing a private key on your servers.

SmartSweep isn’t just an upgrade. It’s a new industry standard.

### Faster onboarding, zero hassle

Getting started has never been easier. We’ve redesigned our onboarding flow to guide you step-by-step, so you can set up and begin accepting funds in as little as **10 minutes**.

### In the works

This is just the beginning. Support for **Solana** and **Ton** with SmartSweep is already in the works, and we can’t wait to share more.

Thank you for building with us. With your support, we’re setting a higher bar for the future of payments.
