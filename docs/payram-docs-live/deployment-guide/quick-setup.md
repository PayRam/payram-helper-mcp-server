## 

[hashtag](#prerequisites)

**Prerequisites**

Before starting, please ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### 

[hashtag](#server-configuration)

**Server configuration**

-   Use a VPS or dedicated server with the minimum specifications required to host the PayRam server.
    

circle-info

**Recommended VPS Providers:**

-   **AWS**
    
-   **Google Cloud (GCP)**
    
-   **Azure**
    
-   **Hetzner**
    
-   **Hostinger**
    

### 

[hashtag](#minimum-server-requirements)

**Minimum server requirements**

-   **CPU**: 4 cores
    
-   **RAM**: 4 GB
    
-   **Storage**: 15 GB+ disk
    
-   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04
    

circle-info

**Note**: Depending on your expected usage and scale, additional resources may be required.

### 

[hashtag](#network-requirements)

**Network requirements**

-   Ensure the following ports are open on your server or VPS:
    
    Port
    
    Purpose
    
    80
    
    Used for running the Frontend (FE) on standard HTTP protocol.
    
    8080
    
    Legacy installs only - older versions served the backend on 8080. Current installers publish both the frontend and the API on port 80 (and 443 with SSL).
    
    443
    
    Required for the Frontend when serving the application over HTTPS (secure connection).
    
    8443
    
    Required for the Backend when serving APIs over HTTPS (secure connection).
    
    5432
    
    Used by the PostgreSQL Database for database connections.
    

### 

[hashtag](#database-configuration)

Database configuration

-   To run PayRam smoothly, you must provision a PostgreSQL database with the following minimum configuration:
    
    **Minimum database requirements**:
    
    -   **Database engine**: PostgreSQL
        
    -   **vCPUs**: 2 CPU cores
        
    -   **Memory**: 8 GB
        
    -   **Storage**: 15 GB+ disk
        
    

circle-info

**Note** : These are the baseline requirements. Using a smaller configuration may cause performance issues during high transaction loads or while processing sweeps. You can scale up depending on the expected transaction volume.

[hashtag](#installing-necessary-dependencies)

Installing necessary dependencies

-   When you run the command, the script handles the entire PayRam setup automatically. It checks for previous installations, validates required ports, detects the operating system, and ensures compatibility. Next, it installs or verifies Docker and PostgreSQL, creates the needed directories, and performs a disk space check. If any problems are found (such as low storage), the script will display a warning and ask you to confirm whether to proceed by typing Y or N.

[hashtag](#database-setup)

Database setup

-   Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to choose between an External PostgreSQL Database or a Containerized PostgreSQL Database for setup.

-   You can select any of the options based on your requirement
    
    -   Option 1
        
    -   Option 2
        
    

circle-info

**Note** : Option 1 is recommended for production environments.

Option 1

Option 2

-   If you select **Option 1**, you’ll be prompted to enter the following details:
    
    -   **Database Host**
        
    -   **Port**
        
    -   **Database Name**
        
    -   **Username**
        
    -   **Password**
        
    
    These details establish the connection between PayRam and your PostgreSQL database.
    
-   You can find them in your PostgreSQL server configuration or your hosting provider’s control panel. If you’re using a managed PostgreSQL service (for example, AWS RDS, Azure Database, or DigitalOcean), these values are available in the database connection settings.
    
-   **Example connection string**:
    
    -   In this example:
        
        -   `myuser` → Database username
            
        -   `mypassword` → Database password
            
        -   `db.example.com` → Database host
            
        -   `5432` → Database port
            
        -   `mydatabase` → Database name
            
        
    

circle-info

**Note** : This option is for testing only. For production environments, always use Option 1.

-   If you select **Option 2**, the script creates a local PostgreSQL database using Docker with the following default credentials:

[hashtag](#ssl-configuration)

SSL configuration

-   After setting up the database, the script will prompt you to configure SSL by choosing from Let’s Encrypt (auto-generate free SSL), Custom Certificates (upload your own), or External SSL (cloud/proxy services).
    

![](https://docs.payram.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.gitbook.com%2Fcontent%2F2diixQuZV5bHAbOknKAq%2Fblobs%2FV8iFlgyPD8twRnnUOs5R%2Fimage.png&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=94e8a016&sv=2)

    -   Option 3
        
    

Option 1

Option 2

Option 3

-   If you select Option 1, Let’s Encrypt will automatically generate and install a free SSL certificate for your domain within minutes, with certificates trusted by all browsers and auto-renewed every 90 days.
